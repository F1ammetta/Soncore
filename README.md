# Soncore

Music Streaming app desinged to work with the [Rustycore](https://github.com/F1ammetta/Rustycore) Music Streaming server developed by me, for anyone to enjoy their music collection on the go without worrying about carrying your collection with you. (not ready for production use)

You can also use [Music Streaming Server](https://github.com/F1ammetta/Music-streaming-server) for the server side, although is significantly slower and less reliable
